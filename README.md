# Cavernforge
A Dwarf Fortress inspired exploration into the simulation of fantasy realms

# Info
After having a look into the world of dwarf fortress, I was hooked by the sheer complexity that is coded within. Being relatively new to programming, I knew that there were many concepts within the scope of a simulation such as this that would test my skills to the limits and boy was I right. This is going to be a long project with many ups and downs but in the end I know it will make me a better coder, and that is all a newb can ask for.
